# AI Tic Tac Toe

## Project idea :
The goal of this project is to implement AI techniques for Tic Tac Toe game.
I want to do this small project to improve my C++ coding skills, especially in low latency programming.
I think this is a good way to begin before starting more ambitious project (chessAI maybe ?)

## Goals :

- Implement a playable tic tac toe game
- Code an AI to play against, using minmax, alpha-beta pruning.
- Test some differents heuristics, add weights, do selection my tournament
- Benchmarking performances

## Done and TO DO : 

- 02/02 : The game is functional (very basic) 

- Have to implement a better interface for player and easier test developpement 
- Starting AI player, thinking about the structure.
- Making something easy to hide games (printing cost a lot of ressources) and start games 
- Looking for files gestions for a C++ project (header, imports...) make something clean
- Checking if code is efficient and benchmark time execution with a lot of games
