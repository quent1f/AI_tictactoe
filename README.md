# AI Tic Tac Toe

## Project idea :
The goal of this project is to implement AI techniques for Tic Tac Toe game.
I want to do this small project to improve my C++ coding skills, especially in low latency programming.
I think this is a good way to begin before starting more ambitious project (chessAI maybe ?)

## Goals :

- Implement a playable tic tac toe game
- Code an AI to play against, using minmax, alpha-beta pruning.
- Test some differents heuristics, add weights, do selection my tournament
- Benchmarking performances

## Done and TO DO : 

- 02/02 : The game is functional (very basic) 
- 06/02 : Implemented Classes for players, Alpha-Beta pruning and cleaner files (headers, main...)

- Complete game interface, Human VS Human, AI vs Human, AI vs AI 
- Have to look for heuristics
- Checking if code is efficient and benchmark time execution with a lot of games
- I have to rethink about structures, efficienty and simplicity
