# AI Tic Tac Toe

## Project idea :

The goal of this project is to implement AI (game theory) techniques for Tic Tac Toe game.
I want to do this small project to improve my C++ coding skills, discovering OOP in C++.


## Goals :

- Implement a playable tic tac toe game
- Code an AI to play against, using minmax, alpha-beta pruning.
- Test some differents heuristics, add weights, do selection with tournament (like a genetic algorithm)
- Benchmarking performances

## Done and TO DO : 

- The game is functional 
- Implemented Classes for players, Alpha-Beta pruning and cleaner files (headers, main...)
- Complete game interface, Human VS Human, AI vs Human, AI vs AI 

- Have to look for heuristics
- Checking if code is efficient and benchmark time execution with a lot of games
